# Cursor Hangs Up After Running Commands: A Complete Workaround

If you're using Cursor (the AI-powered code editor) and experiencing frustrating hangs where the terminal gets stuck in a "generating..." state after running commands, you're not alone. This issue is particularly common among developers using ZSH with custom themes like Powerlevel10k.

## üö® The Problem

When using Cursor's terminal, you might notice:

- ‚è≥ Commands execute but Cursor remains in "generating..." state indefinitely
- üîÑ The interface becomes unresponsive after terminal operations
- üñ±Ô∏è You need to manually click "Move to Background" to regain control
- üì± The AI assistant stops responding until you intervene

This significantly disrupts the development workflow and makes Cursor's AI features less effective.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

Based on community discussions in [Cursor's GitHub repository](https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-agent-mode-when-running-terminal-commands-often-hangs-up-the-terminal-requiring-a-click-to-pop-it-out-in-order-to-continue-commands/59969/16), the issue stems from **Cursor's inability to properly parse complex shell prompts**.

### Why This Happens:

- **Complex Themes**: Powerlevel10k and similar themes use Unicode characters, colors, and complex formatting
- **Prompt Detection**: Cursor struggles to identify when a command has finished executing
- **Terminal Parsing**: The AI can't distinguish between the prompt and command output
- **VSCode Base**: Since Cursor is built on VSCode, it inherits some terminal parsing limitations

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Conditional Theme Loading

The most effective workaround is to **disable complex themes specifically for Cursor** while keeping them for your regular terminal usage.

### Step 1: Backup Your Configuration

Before making changes, backup your current ZSH configuration:

```bash
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
```

### Step 2: Modify Your ~/.zshrc

Open your ZSH configuration file:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
# or
code ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Add Conditional Theme Logic

Replace your existing theme configuration with this conditional setup:

```bash
# =============================================================================
# CURSOR COMPATIBILITY CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Detect if we're running in Cursor/VSCode
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]]; then
  # Simple theme for Cursor compatibility
  ZSH_THEME=""
  
  # Set a clean, minimal prompt
  PROMPT='%F{blue}%n@%m%f:%F{green}%~%f%# '
  RPROMPT='%F{yellow}[%T]%f'
  
  # Optional: Add git status for Cursor
  autoload -Uz vcs_info
  precmd() { vcs_info }
  zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats '%F{red}(%b)%f'
  PROMPT='%F{blue}%n@%m%f:%F{green}%~%f${vcs_info_msg_0_}%# '
  
else
  # Full-featured theme for regular terminal
  ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
fi

# Load Oh My Zsh
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# =============================================================================
# POST-LOADING CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Load Powerlevel10k config only for non-Cursor terminals
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" != "vscode" && -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]]; then
  source ~/.p10k.zsh
fi

# Optional: Add Cursor-specific aliases
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]]; then
  alias ll='ls -la'
  alias cls='clear'
  # Add your preferred aliases here
fi
```

### Step 4: Alternative Minimal Configuration

If you prefer an even simpler approach, use this minimal version:

```bash
# Minimal Cursor-compatible configuration
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]]; then
  ZSH_THEME=""
  PROMPT='%n@%m:%~%# '
  RPROMPT=''
else
  ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
fi

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# Load P10k config for non-Cursor terminals only
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" != "vscode" ]]; then
  [[ -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] && source ~/.p10k.zsh
fi
```

## üîÑ Testing the Solution

### Step 1: Reload Your Configuration

After saving the changes, reload your ZSH configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 2: Restart Cursor

Close and reopen Cursor completely to ensure the new configuration takes effect.

### Step 3: Test Terminal Commands

Try running various commands in Cursor to verify the fix:

```bash
# Test basic commands
pwd
ls -la

# Test longer running commands
npm install
git status

# Test interactive commands
ping google.com -c 3
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After implementing this fix, you should experience:

- ‚úÖ **No More Hanging**: Commands complete normally without getting stuck
- ‚úÖ **Faster Response**: Cursor's AI responds immediately after command execution
- ‚úÖ **Clean Prompts**: Simple, readable terminal output
- ‚úÖ **Maintained Functionality**: All your aliases and functions still work
- ‚úÖ **Best of Both Worlds**: Full theme in regular terminal, compatibility in Cursor

## üîß Advanced Customization

### Custom Cursor Prompt

You can create a more informative prompt specifically for Cursor:

```bash
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]]; then
  # Custom Cursor prompt with git info
  autoload -Uz vcs_info
  precmd() { vcs_info }
  zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats ' [%F{red}%b%f]'
  
  PROMPT='%F{cyan}cursor%f %F{blue}%n%f@%F{green}%m%f:%F{yellow}%~%f${vcs_info_msg_0_}
%F{magenta}‚ûú%f '
fi
```

### Environment-Specific Aliases

Add Cursor-specific shortcuts:

```bash
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]]; then
  alias c='clear'
  alias l='ls -CF'
  alias la='ls -A'
  alias ll='ls -alF'
  alias ..='cd ..'
  alias ...='cd ../..'
fi
```

## üõü Troubleshooting

### If the Issue Persists:

1. **Check Environment Variable**: Verify Cursor sets the correct variable:
   ```bash
   echo $TERM_PROGRAM
   ```

2. **Try Alternative Detection**: Some setups might need different detection:
   ```bash
   if [[ "$VSCODE_INJECTION" == "1" ]] || [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]]; then
   ```

3. **Complete Theme Disable**: For stubborn cases, temporarily disable all themes:
   ```bash
   ZSH_THEME=""
   ```

4. **Check Oh My Zsh Plugins**: Some plugins might interfere:
   ```bash
   plugins=(git)  # Minimal plugin set for testing
   ```

## üéâ Conclusion

This workaround effectively resolves the Cursor hanging issue while maintaining the rich terminal experience you're used to. The conditional configuration ensures you get the best of both worlds: **compatibility in Cursor and full theming in your regular terminal**.

While this is a temporary solution until Cursor officially fixes the underlying parsing issue, it provides a stable development environment that doesn't compromise your workflow.

**üí° Pro Tip**: Consider creating a shell script to quickly switch between different prompt configurations if you frequently switch between different editors and terminal setups.
