### AI Integration
- **Google Gemini API**: Advanced AI model for content generation with style consistency
- **Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated templates for different blog post types with style guide integration
- **Content Processing**: Automatic frontmatter generation and markdown formatting

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: React Context with SHA256 hashing and environment variable security
- **Content**: Markdown files with frontmatter metadata processed server-side
- **AI Services**: Google Gemini API for intelligent content generation
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic deployments and GitHub API integration
- **Email**: Resend API for contact form functionality with professional templates
- **Styling**: Custom design system with dark/light theme support and responsive layout
- **Development Tools**: Stagewise AI integration for enhanced development experience

## Admin Features

### Authentication Flow
