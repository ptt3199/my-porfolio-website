# Setup Server CLI Go

A **minimal CLI tool written in Go** to automate the setup of a personal Ubuntu server for backend development. This project emerged from my need to **convert an old laptop into a development server** and provides an interactive interface to install essential packages like SSH, Docker, tmux, and other development tools â€” all in one streamlined process.

## Project Context

This CLI tool was created as part of a larger initiative to **turn my old laptop into a personal development server**. Instead of manually installing and configuring each tool every time I set up a new server environment, I built this automated solution to handle the repetitive setup tasks efficiently.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Interactive CLI Experience
- **Main Menu Navigation**: Choose between different installation categories
- **Selective Installation**: Pick specific tools to install rather than everything at once
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time installation progress with emoji indicators
- **Return to Menu**: Continue installing additional tools after each operation completes
- **Multiple Selection**: Install single tools, multiple tools, or everything with flexible input options

### ðŸ“¦ Comprehensive Tool Support

#### System Accessories
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer for session management and persistent sessions
- **git** - Version control system for development workflows
- **curl** - Command line tool for data transfer and API testing
- **htop** - Interactive process viewer for system monitoring
- **ufw** - Uncomplicated Firewall for security configuration
- **zsh** - Advanced shell with improved features over bash

#### Services & Runtime
- **SSH Server** - Secure remote access configuration (openssh-server)
- **Docker Complete Stack** - Comprehensive Docker installation including:
  - Docker Engine (Community Edition)
  - Docker CLI tools
  - containerd.io runtime
  - Docker Buildx Plugin for multi-platform builds
  - Docker Compose Plugin for orchestration
  - Automatic user addition to docker group for non-root usage

## Technical Architecture

### Go Implementation Benefits
- **Fast Execution**: Compiled binary with minimal startup overhead
- **Cross-Platform**: Native builds for Linux x86_64, ARM64, and macOS
- **Single Binary**: No dependencies or runtime requirements
- **Concurrent Operations**: Goroutines handle multiple installations efficiently
- **Memory Efficient**: Low resource usage compared to interpreted languages

### CLI Design Patterns
- **Command Pattern**: Modular command structure with root, accessories, and docker commands
- **Interactive Prompts**: User-friendly input handling with validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and user feedback
- **Progress Indication**: Visual feedback during long-running operations

## Development Learnings

### Go CLI Development
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **Cobra Framework**: Building structured CLI applications with subcommands
- **Cross-compilation**: Targeting multiple platforms from single codebase
- **Package Management**: Go modules and dependency management
- **Error Handling**: Go's explicit error handling patterns
- **Testing**: Unit testing CLI functionality and command execution

### GoReleaser Integration
This project taught me about **modern Go release management**:
- **Automated Builds**: Multi-platform binary generation
- **GitHub Releases**: Automatic release creation with changelogs
- **Package Distribution**: DEB and RPM packages for Linux distributions
- **Archive Management**: Properly named tar.gz files with checksums
- **Release Workflows**: Integration with GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Mode
```bash
ðŸš€ Server Setup CLI
Choose an option:
1. Install accessories
2. Install Docker
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1-3): 1

Choose accessories to install:
1. tmux
2. git
3. curl
4. htop
5. ufw
6. zsh
Enter the number of the accessory to install (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.) or 'all' to install all accessories: 1 3 5

Installing tmux...
âœ… Done: sudo apt-get install -y tmux
Installing curl...
âœ… Done: sudo apt-get install -y curl
Installing ufw...
âœ… Done: sudo apt-get install -y ufw
Accessories installed successfully

âœ… Press Enter to return to main menu...
```

### Flexible Selection Options
- **Single Tool**: `1` - Install tmux only
- **Multiple Tools**: `1 2 3` - Install tmux, git, and curl
- **Everything**: `all` - Install all available accessories
- **Menu Navigation**: Return to main menu for additional installations

## Release Management

### Multi-Platform Distribution
Each release provides comprehensive platform support:
- **Linux x86_64**: `setup-server-cli_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` - Standard servers
- **Linux ARM64**: `setup-server-cli_Linux_arm64.tar.gz` - Raspberry Pi, ARM servers
- **macOS Intel**: `setup-server-cli_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` - Intel Macs
- **macOS Apple Silicon**: `setup-server-cli_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz` - M1/M2 Macs
- **Debian Packages**: `.deb` files for Ubuntu/Debian systems
- **RedHat Packages**: `.rpm` files for CentOS/RHEL systems
- **Checksums**: SHA256 verification for security

### Build Process
```bash
# Development builds (local testing)
./build-cli.sh

# Release candidate (testing)
./build-cli.sh release snapshot

# Tagged release (production)
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
./build-cli.sh release
```
